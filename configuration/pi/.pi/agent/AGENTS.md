# Coding principles

- All code is a burden, minimise it.
- Avoid overengineering, start with the simplest thing that could possibly work.
- Rather than adding complexity to handle edge cases, look for a design that erradicates them.
- For long lived code, tests are not optional and they specify the behaviour.
- Assume all code you write is broken until proven otherwise.
- Follow the coding conventions and style of existing code.
- If you need to challenge the design or style, clearly state that and look for somewhere to record that decision.
- Code comments are usually unnecessary, look to improve design and naming to express the intent.
