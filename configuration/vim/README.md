# Vim Setup

Vim is configured via a `.vimrc` config file and a suite of vimscriot files following the vim runtimepath conventions so that they sre discovered and sourced by vim automatically at the correct time.

Plugins are managed by `vim-plugin` and configured in the `.vimrc` file.

## Usage

Inside Vim issue commands to update the plugins:

```
:PlugUpgrade
:PlugInstall
:PlugUpdate
```
