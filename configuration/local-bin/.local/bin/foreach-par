# NAME
#   foreach-par - run the given command in parallel with each line of
#     input as an argument
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   seq 10 | foreach-par sleep
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Lots of commands operate on a file line by line but it can be useful to
#   run a command on each line independently.  `xargs -P0 -n1 ...` is one way
#   to achieve that, this script aims to make it easier to remember.
