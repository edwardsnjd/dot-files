# NAME
#   foreach - run the given command with each line of input as an argument
#
# SYNOPSIS
#   seq 10 | centre [--width <width>] [--filler <filler>] [--help]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#   Lots of commands operate on a file line by line but it can be useful to
#   run a command on each line independently.  `xargs -n1 ...` is one way
#   to achieve that, this script aims to make it easier to remember.

  # See: http://mywiki.wooledge.org/DontReadLinesWithFor
  # NOTE: Will skip blank lines in input
  while IFS= read -r line; do
    $* "$line"
  done
}
